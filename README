This code compresses and decompresses a data stream using a combination of
compression techniques that are optimized for compressing disk image data.

Compression methods used by this program include:

* Run-length encoding (RLE), packing long repetitions of a single byte value
  into a short value:length pair

* Lempel-Ziv (dictionary-based) compression with optimized searching

* Sequential increment compression, where 8-, 16-, and 32-bit values that
  are incremented by 1 are converted to a pair consisting of an  inital value
  and a count

* Bit plane transformation, putting bytes at evenly spaced intervals together
  to allow compression of some forms of otherwise incompressible data

The decompression utility uses POSIX threads by default. If you want to use
a smaller, much simpler, and slower non-threaded version, tell make:

make NOTHREADS=1
